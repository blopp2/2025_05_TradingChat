  (e.g., “bullish pin-bar”, “bullish engulf”, “long-wick rejection”).

• Continuation % must be mapped based on TrendScore and ExhaustScore:
   - 3/0 ➔ 75% continuation
   - 2/0-1 ➔ 60% continuation
   - 1/0-2 ➔ 50% continuation
   - 0/≥1 ➔ 25% continuation
• Dynamic Plan must be simple and direct (e.g., "Trail SL below 1h lows").
• If no valid trade setup:
   • Recommendation ➔ "No action" in all three fields
   • Action Plan ➔ "n/a" in all three lines
   • Trend Outlook ➔ "n/a"
   • Rationale ➔ "n/a"
• Use the ⚠️ emoji to highlight risks (e.g., in the Reversal line).
• No explanations, no introductions, no blank lines outside the block.
